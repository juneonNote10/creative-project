# Creative Project Description
I and my friends are big fans of animation, especially Japanese animation. 
We often look for new animation to watch but since there are a lot of animations in the world, it is difficult for us to decide which one to watch first.
Thus, I decided to create a website that helps users to find animations to watch and build a schedule for watching animations.

## Home
Inside the home tab, there is a list of animations that are uploaded by users.
Since there is a countless amount of animations in the world, I cannot put all of the animations into the database.
Also, there are many animations I do not know.
Therefore, I decided to let users upload animations.
In the home tab, users can search for animation by title. Users can also add animations to their list.

## Upload
Users need to log in to upload animations.
Also, users need to upload a photo of the animation and some information.

## Schedule
Inside the schedule tab, on the right side, users can see the list of animations that are not scheduled.
Users can add animations from that list to the schedule.
Then, users can slide the photo of animation that is scheduled so he/she can see the next animation to watch.

## Profile
If the user has logged in, then he/she will see his/her profile page.
At there, there are user's animation list and the list of animation that the user has watched so far.

## Animation Page
From every tab, users can enter the specific animation page by clicking its photo.
On the page, there is information that the uploader submitted.
If the animation is the user's list, the page will display the "remove from list" button.
On contrary, if the animation is not on the list, there will be the "add to list" button.
Also, there is a checkbox to set the animation that the user watched.
If the user sets the animation as watched, the animation will automatically be removed from the user's list and schedule.
